   # COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## üìå Project Description

This project is a Python-based data analysis and visualization tool that tracks global COVID-19 trends. It processes data from Our World in Data to examine cases, deaths, and vaccination statistics across countries over time. The project culminates in a Jupyter Notebook containing code, visualizations, and narrative insights.

## üéØ Project Objectives

* Import and clean COVID-19 global data
* Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
* Compare metrics across selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India)
* Visualize data with line charts, bar charts, and an optional choropleth map
* Communicate key insights in a well-documented report

## üß∞ Tools and Libraries Used

* **pandas**: for data manipulation and cleaning
* **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: for data visualization
* **plotly.express**: for interactive choropleth maps
* **Jupyter Notebook**: for documentation, analysis, and presentation

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. Download the `owid-covid-data.csv` file from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data).
2. Place the file in the project directory.
3. Open `covid19_data_tracker.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run each cell to load data, clean it, generate visualizations, and read insights.
5. Optional: Export the notebook as a PDF or presentation via `File > Export` in Jupyter.

## üîç Key Insights

* The United States had the highest number of total COVID-19 cases among the selected countries.
* India showed a rapid vaccination rollout beginning in early 2021.
* Kenya had a slower but steady increase in both cases and vaccinations.
* The death rate in the USA is significantly higher than in India and Kenya.
* Time series charts reveal distinct infection waves in each country.
